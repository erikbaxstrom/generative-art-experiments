Some experiments with generative art

## 10print

10print, the [classic](https://10print.org/) C64 one-liner. And now, with varied brush strokes.

Looked interesting, even before adding the randomly alternating slashes.

With the slashes heavily biased in one direction and more iterations.

# Exploring gcode

Gcode is the set of instructions commonly used by 3d printers. As a next step, I'm going to attach a pen to my 3d printer and use it as a pen plotter.
